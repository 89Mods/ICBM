##What is ICBM?
--NOTE--The current 1.7.10 versions are complete rewrites of ICBM, most things from 1.6.4 are not implemented yet. but they are planned to be implemented later, either in ICBM or in seperate mods. --NOTE--
ICBM is a Minecraft Mod that introduces intercontinental ballistic missiles to Minecraft. But the fun doesn't end there! This mod also features many different explosives, missiles and machines classified in three different tiers. If strategic warfare, carefully coordinated airstrikes, messing with matter and general destruction are up your alley, then this mod is for you!

##Who owns ICBM
Originally ICBM was owned mostly by Calclavia with the Sentry guns belonging to DarkGuardsman. After a few event and lake of progress ownship was shifted fully to DarkGuardsman. This was in exchange for majority ownership of Resonant Induction to Calclavia. 

That being said as far as DarkGuardsman is concerned the mod downloads are community properity. At any time the mod is no longer supported or updated anyone is welcome to take over. Given that the new maintainer understand who owns the code at the end of the day.
